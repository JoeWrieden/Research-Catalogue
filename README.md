# Research Catalogue

## Introduction

This is a collection of links to my public research papers and blogs I have completed since beginning in the CTI space. These have been collated from across research completed both at work, as well as during academia.



## Who is Trickbot?

[Link to paper](https://www.cyjax.com/who-is-trickbot/)

Within this paper I analysed the contents of the Trickbot Leaks; a collection of leaks which contained over 250,000 messages. I break down the information found within the leaks, as well as exploring how this information gives us a greater insight into how cybercriminal groups operate.

## An Analysis of the Threats Posed by Botnet Malware Targeting Vulnerable Cryptocurrency Miners

[Link to paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10201027)

This paper was a condensed version of the research conducted as part of my dissertation for my undergraduate Computer Science degree. Within it I explore the potential threats posed to cryptocurrency mining software should it be targeted by a botnet. Through developing a test scenario and malware, I explore how through an attack I coin as "Forced Pooling" an attacker could effectively create an unconsentual mining pool of devices. Opposed to the traditional cryptojacking attack this poses its own unique threats, especially when considering the powerful hardware behind most cryptocurrency miners. This paper was published and presented as part of the [Fourteenth International Conference on Ubiquitous and Future Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10199107/proceeding).



## DDoSaaS: An analytical overview of the DDoS-as-a-Service landscape

[Link to paper](https://www.cyjax.com/ddosaas-an-analytical-overview-of-the-ddos-as-a-service-landscape)

This paper explores the trend towards the usage of DDoS-as-a-Service techniques within the cybercriminal landscape. The "as-a-Service" has become popular within traditional businesses as an efficient and effective way to deliver services to users. This has been mimicked within cybercrime, with cybercriminals utilising the same techniques to further their own goal. WIthin the paper we explore how DDoS has been adopted to this model, and the impact this has on the wider cyber threat landscape.



## Cryptocurrency Threat Landscape Series

This series of papers, explores the ever changing threat landscape facing the cryptocurrency sector. I have been writing this series since 2022, with the first paper [Ten Ways to Lose Your Crypto](https://www.cyjax.com/ten-ways-to-lose-your-crypto/) starting the series by recapping the top 10 threats I identified at the time. Since then, originally monthly, and then quarterly I have reviewed the ever changing threat landscape facing the cryptocurrency sector. Through this I have outlined technical attacks to blockchain technologies, as well as the evolution of more traditional attacks to target the cryptocurrency space.
